# Recipes Project

## Description 

Recently, in addition to other self-study resources I am currently engaged with, I have added The Odin Project to the mix as it was highly recommended through my network. 

The first part of this course requested the usage of HTML and CSS to create a simple recipe menu landing site. It was a great opportunity to practice and hone skills I have picked up recently.

This project combined my two interests: 1) Front-end coding (of course) and 2) Cyberpunk/Video Game culture. The web page outlines the various drinks offered in the iconic Afterlife bar, and each drink title then links to its respective YouTube video to allow the user to understand how to re-create the drink. 

I have utilised a fitting GIF background as well as some interactive aspects such as icons/sections transforming upon mouse hovering. 

Overtime, I will aim to update this project as I learn more skills, in particular I am looking to improve this by delving deeper into JavaScript in order to create more dynamic and responsive work.
